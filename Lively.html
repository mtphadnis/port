                <p>
                    Live.ly is a mockup of an app that my classmates and I created for our UI/UX 2 class. We were posed with a challenge to solve and we chose loneliness among elderly folk.
                    Seniors today are facing increasing levels of loneliness, and the Covid-19 Pandemic has increased these circumstances, by decreasing the level of face-to-face contact seniors have with their families and peers.
                    Due to ageism, this is often overlooked. However loneliness contributes to a higher mortality rate (and a higher chance of developing deadly diseases) within the senior population.
                    <br />
                    <h3> Our Idea and Mission Statement</h3>
                    Live.ly- Helping seniors have a better life by forming honest connections.
                    We help seniors form connections and live life to the fullest by building relationships on a strong online community. Helping seniors overcome the challenges of life and learn new things everyday is our goal.
                    Create an app for seniors that connects them to people with similar interests, giving them the ability to join clubs, talk on forums, and even host live calls.
                    Live.ly would combine the major features of several popular social media apps. The maintenance of this app would also focus on the senior community, and make sure that challenges they find with other social media apps aren’t present.
                    The app would be visually appealing to seniors and uncomplicated design- that way there’s more time spent on fostering connections and less time spent learning the app’s UI.

                <h3>Our Unique Selling Point</h3>
                <p>
                    Seniors look for apps that connect them with their friends and family the most.
                    A challenge to this is privacy and safety for seniors, many of whom unassumingly fall victim to scams.
                    We want seniors to stay safe and foster healthy connections, without having to worry about data leaks or their information being compromised.
                    Our app will make it easy for them to control how much information they share with others through clear communication and design.
